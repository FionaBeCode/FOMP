Is it in progress? Do you want to make any changes? Do you want us to help you?
What's in it?

What's in it? Help us to understand in one sentence what we should discover in several minutes: is it in MVC, in laravel? Is it made from A to Z? Is there a database? If so, is the MCD (conceptual data model) complicated? Can you put it in the readme?
How do you install it?

It's always good to explain to friends how to set up your work locally. Either so they can use it or so they can help you improve it!
Where did it come from? A client or an exercise to do in class... Specify!
Small examples to illustrate
